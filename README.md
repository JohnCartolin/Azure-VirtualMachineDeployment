# Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine Deployment & Management


## Project Summary
This project is a **step-by-step tutorial and demonstration** of creating, configuring, connecting to, and cleaning up an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). It was designed as a **hands-on cloud computing lab** to build technical skills and demonstrate familiarity with Azure services. The project follows industry-relevant steps for provisioning infrastructure in the cloud and aligns with common tasks an IT professional might perform in a real work environment.

**Type:** Technology Implementation & Walkthrough  
**Languages Used:** N/A (GUI-based configuration; can be extended with PowerShell)  
**Environments Used:** Microsoft Azure, Windows 10 (local environment)  
**Technologies/Services Used:** Azure Portal, Azure Resource Groups, Azure Virtual Machines, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)  

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note  

This walkthrough covers the **basic standard settings** for creating and starting a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure.  

If you‚Äôre interested in more **advanced configurations** (such as scaling, custom networking, or automation with scripts), I plan to cover those in a future project/video.  

For now, this guide focuses on the essentials to help you quickly get a VM up and running.

Follow step 1 once you created an account with Microsoft Azure.
### Step 1 ‚Äî Microsoft Azure Home Page
Start from the **Azure Portal home page**.  
We‚Äôre going to create a **Resource Group** first.  
A resource group is like a folder where you keep everything organized.  
Anything you create in Azure ‚Äî like Virtual Machines, Networking, Databases, or AI services ‚Äî will belong to a resource group. This helps keep resources managed and grouped together.
